# Call Microsoft Graph in a service or daemon app

In this article we look at the minimum tasks required to connect your single-tenant service or daemon app to Office 365 and call the Microsoft Graph API.

## Overview

To call the Microsoft Graph API in a service or daemon app, you have to complete the following tasks.

1. Register the application in Azure Active Directory.
2. Request an access token from the token issuing endpoint.
3. Use the access token in a request to the Microsoft Graph API.

## Register the application in Azure Active Directory

Before you can start working with Office 365, you need to register your application and set permissions to use Microsoft Graph services.
With just a few clicks, you can register your application using the [Application Registration Tool](https://dev.office.com/app-registration). You will need to go to the [Microsoft Azure Management portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com) to manage it.

Alternatively, see the section [Register your web server app with the Azure Management Portal](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office365/HowTo/add-common-consent-manually#bk_RegisterServerApp) for instructions on how to manually register the app, keep in mind the following details:

* After you register the application, configure the **Application Permissions** that your service or daemon app requires.

Take note of the following values in the Configure page of your Azure application because you need these values to configure the OAuth flow in your service or daemon app.

* Client ID (unique to your application)
* An application key (unique to your application)
* Your app's OAuth 2.0 token endpoint
  * Find this value by clicking *View Endpoints* at the bottom of the Azure Management Portal in your app's page. The endpoint will look like `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenantId>/oauth2/token`.

## Request an access token from the token issuing endpoint

Unlike client apps, your service or daemon app is unable to have a user sign in and authorize your application. Instead, your application has to implement the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant Flow that lets it use its own credentials, its client ID and an application key, to authenticate when calling the Microsoft Graph instead of impersonating a user. Refer to [Service to Service Calls Using Client Credentials](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn645543.aspx) for details about the authentication flow.

Make an HTTP POST request to the token issuing endpoint with the following parameters, replacing `<clientId>` and `<clientSecret>` with your app's client ID and application key, respectively.

```http
POST https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenantId>/oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=client_credentials
&client_id=<clientId>
&client_secret=<clientSecret>
&resource=https://graph.microsoft.com
```

The response will include an access token and expiry information.

```json
{ 
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": "3599",
  "scope": "User.Read",
  "expires_on": "1449685363",
  "not_before": "1449681463",
  "resource": "https://graph.microsoft.com",
  "access_token": "<token>"
}
```

## Use the access token in a request to the Microsoft Graph API

With an access token, your app can make authenticated requests to the Microsoft Graph API. Your app must append the access token to the **Authorization** header of each request.

For example, a service or daemon app can retrieve all the users in a tenant if it has the *Read all users' full profiles* permission selected in the Azure Management Portal. 

```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

The Microsoft Graph is a very powerful, unifiying API that can be used to interact with all kinds of Microsoft data. Check out the [API reference](http://graph.microsoft.io/docs/api-reference/v1.0) to explore what else you can accomplish with the Microsoft Graph API.
