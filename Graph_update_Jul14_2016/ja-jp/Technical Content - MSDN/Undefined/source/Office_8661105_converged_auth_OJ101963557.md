# Authenticate Microsoft Graph endpoints using the v2 authentication endpoint


<!--
### Preview documentation
There are features and functionality of the converged authentication model that are not yet supported in the public preview period. You should be aware of them if you are building applications during the public preview. For more information, see [Limitations and restrictions of the converged authentication model preview](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-v2-limitations/).

## Signing in Microsoft account and Azure AD users with a single authentication model

By using the v2 authentication endpoint, you can create apps that accept both work and school (Azure AD) as well as personal (Microsoft account) identities.

In the past, if you wanted to develop an app to support both Microsoft accounts and Azure Active Directory, you had to integrate with two completely separate systems. Using the v2 authentication endpoint, you can now support both types of accounts with a single integration. One simple process to immediately reach an audience that spans millions of users with both personal and work/school accounts.   

After you integrate your apps with the v2 authentication endpoint, they can instantly access the Microsoft Graph endpoints available for both personal and work/school accounts, such as: 

| Data              | Endpoint                                       |
|:------------------|:-----------------------------------------------|
| User profile      | `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me`          |
| Outlook mail      | `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/messages` |
| Outlook contacts  | `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/contacts` |
| Outlook calendars | `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/events`   |
| OneDrive          | `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/drive`    |

 >**Note:** Some Microsoft Graph endpoints such as groups and tasks are not applicable to personal accounts.  

## Microsoft Graph API authentication scopes

The v2 authentication endpoint supports all permission scopes listed for use with Azure AD authentication in the [Microsoft Graph permission scopes](permission_scopes.md) topic. However, the v2 authentication endpoint does not currently support app-only scopes.

>**Note:** Currently, you are required to pass the resource URL 'https://graph.microsoft.com' as the prefix for the scope string. For example, to use the `Files.Read` scope, specify the scope as `https://graph.microsoft.com/Files.Read`.

For more information about using scopes with the v2 authentication endpoint, and how it differs from using resources in Azure AD, see [Scopes, not resources](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-v2-compare/#scopes-not-resources).
