# Calling Microsoft Graph

###Call Microsoft Graph API service via REST
To access and manipulate a Microsoft Graph API resource, you call and specify the resource URLs using one of the following operations permitted on the resource.   

- GET
- POST
- PATCH
- PUT
- DELETE 

All Microsoft Graph API requests use the following basic URL pattern:

```
	https://graph.microsoft.com/{version}/{resource}?[odata_query_parameters]
```

For this URL:

- `https://graph.microsoft.com` is the Microsoft Graph API endpoint
- `{version}` is the target service version, for example, `v1.0` or `beta`.
- `{resource}` is resource segment or path, such as
  - `users`, `groups`, `devices`, `organization`
  - The alias `me`, which resolves to the signed-in user
   - The resources belonging to a user, such as `me/events`, `me/drive` or `me/messages`
  - The alias `myOrganization`, which resolves to the tenant of the organization signed-in user
- `[odata_query_parameters]` represents additional OData query parameters such as `$filter` and `$select` 

Additionally you can specify the tenant as part of your request, which is optional and not required. When using `me`, do not specify the tenant. A summary of common requests are available in the [overview](overview.md).

###Microsoft Graph API metadata
The service document ($metadata) is published at the service root. For example, you can view the service document for the v1.0 and beta versions via the following URLs.

Microsoft Graph API `v1.0` metadata.
```
	https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata
```
Microsoft Graph API `beta` metadata.
```
	https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/$metadata
```

The metadata allows you to see entities, entity types and sets, complex types and enums of the Microsoft Graph REST API. Using the metadata and readily available third-party tools, you can create serialized objects and generate client libraries for simplified 
use of the REST API.  

A resource URL is determined by the Microsoft Graph entity data model. The prescription is outlined in the entity metadata schema ($metadata). 

The path URL resource names, query parameters, and action parameters and values are case insensitive. However, values you assign, entity IDs, and 
other base64 encoded values are case sensitive.

A few basic programming patterns calls to the API are shown in the following section.

###Navigation from a set to a member

To view the information about a user, you get the `User` entity from the `users` collection to the specific user identified by its identifier, using an HTTPS GET request. For a `User` entity, either the `id` or `userPrincipalName` property may be used as the identifier. The following example request uses the `userPrincipalName` value as the user's id. 

```no-highlight 
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/john.doe@contoso.onmicrosoft.com HTTP/1.1
Authorization : Bearer <access_token>
```

If successful, you should get a 200 OK response containing the user resource representation in the payload, as shown as follows:

```no-highlight 
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-type: application/json;odata.metadata=minimal
content-length: 982

{
    "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#users/$entity",
    "id": "c95e3b3a-c33b-48da-a6e9-eb101e8a4205",
    "city": "Redmond",
    "country": "USA",
    "department": "Help Center",
    "displayName": "John Doe",
    "givenName": "John",
    "userPrincipalName": "Johndoe@contoso.onmicrosoft.com",

    ... 
}
```


###Projection from an entity to properties
To retrieve only the user's biographical data, such as the user's provided _About me_ description and their skill set, you can add the $select query option to the previous request. For example,

```no-highlight 
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/john.doe@contoso.onmicrosoft.com?$select=displayName,aboutMe,skills HTTP/1.1
Authorization : Bearer <access_token>
```

The successful response returns the 200 OK status and a payload of the following format:

```no-highlight 
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-type: application/json;odata.metadata=minimal
content-length: 169

{
    "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#users/$entity",
    "aboutMe": "A cool and nice guy.",
    "displayName": "John Doe",
    "skills": [
        "n-Lingual",
        "public speaking",
        "doodling"
    ]
}
```

Here, instead of the entire property sets on the `user` entity, only the `aboutMe`, `displayName` and `skills` properties, are returned.

###Traversal to another resource via relationship
A manager holds a `directReports` relationship with the other users reporting to him or her. To query the list of the direct reports of a user, you can use the following HTTPS GET request to navigate to the intended target via relationship traversal. 

```no-highlight 
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/john.doe@contoso.onmicrosoft.com/directReports HTTP/1.1
Authorization : Bearer <access_token>
```

The successful response returns the 200 OK status and a payload of the following format:

```no-highlight 
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-type: application/json;odata.metadata=minimal
content-length: 152
    
{
    "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#directoryObjects/$entity",
    "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.user",
    "id": "c37b074d-fe9d-4e68-83ad-b4401d3be174",
    "department": "Sales & Marketing",
    "displayName": "Bonnie Kearney",

    ...
}
```

Similarly, you can follow a relationship to navigate to related resources. For example, the `user => messages` relationship enables graph traversal from an Azure AD node to an Exchange Online node. The below example show how to do this in a REST API call:


```no-highlight 
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/messages HTTP/1.1
Authorization : Bearer <access_token>
```

    
The successful response returns the 200 OK status and a payload of the following format:


```no-highlight 
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-type: application/json;odata.metadata=minimal
odata-version: 4.0
content-length: 147
    
{
  "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#users('john.doe%40contoso.onmicrosoft.com')/Messages",
  "@odata.nextLink": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/messages?$top=1&$skip=1",
  "value": [
    {
      "@odata.etag": "W/\"FwAAABYAAABMR67yw0CmT4x0kVgQUH/3AAJL+Kej\"",
      "id": "<id-value>",
      "createdDateTime": "2015-11-14T00:24:42Z",
      "lastModifiedDateTime": "2015-11-14T00:24:42Z",
      "changeKey": "FwAAABYAAABMR67yw0CmT4x0kVgQUH/3AAJL+Kej",
      "categories": [],
      "receivedDateTime": "2015-11-14T00:24:42Z",
      "sentDateTime": "2015-11-14T00:24:28Z",
      "hasAttachments": false,
      "subject": "Did you see last night's game?",
      "body": {
        "ContentType": "HTML",
        "Content": "<content>"
      },
      "BodyPreview": "it was great!",
      "Importance": "Normal",
            
       ...
    }
  ]
}
```

###Projection from entities to properties
In addition to projection from a single entity to its properties, you can also apply the similar `$select` query option to an entity collection to project them to a collection of some of their properties. For example, to query the name of the signed-in user's drive items, you can submit the following HTTPS GET request:

```no-highlight 
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/drive/root/children?$select=name HTTP/1.1
Authorization : Bearer <access_token>
```

The successful response returns a 200 OK status code and a payload containing the names and types of the shared files, as shown in the following example:

```no-highlight 
{
  "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#users('john.doe%40contoso.onmicrosoft.com')/drive/root/children(name,type)",
  "value": [
    {
      "@odata.etag": "\"{896A8E4D-27BF-424B-A0DA-F073AE6570E2},2\"",
      "name": "Shared with Everyone"
    },
    {
      "@odata.etag": "\"{B39D5D2E-E968-491A-B0EB-D5D0431CB423},1\"",
      "name": "Documents"
    },
    {
      "@odata.etag": "\"{9B51EA38-3EE6-4DC1-96A6-230E325EF054},2\"",
      "name": "newFile.txt"
    }
  ]
}
```

###Query a subset of users with the filtering query option
To find the employees of a specific job title within an organization, you can navigate from the users collection and then specify a $filter query option. An example is shown as follows:

    
```no-highlight 
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/?$filter=jobTitle+eq+%27Helper%27 HTTP/1.1
Authorization : Bearer <access_token>
```

The successful response returns the 200 OK status code and a list of users with the specified job title (`'Helper'`), as shown in the following example:

```no-highlight 
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-type: application/json;odata.metadata=minimal;odata.streaming=true;IEEE754Compatible=false;charset=utf-8
odata-version: 4.0
content-length: 986

{
    "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/contoso.onmicrosoft.com/$metadata#users",
    "value": [
        {
            "id": "c95e3b3a-c33b-48da-a6e9-eb101e8a4205",
            "city": "Redmond",
            "country": "USA",
            "department": "Help Center",
            "displayName": "Jane Doe",
            "givenName": "Jane",
            "jobTitle": "Helper",
            ......
            "mailNickname": "Jane",
            "mobile": null,
            "otherMails": [
                "jane.doe@contoso.onmicrosoft.com"
            ],
            ......
            "surname": "Doe",
            "usageLocation": "US",
            "userPrincipalName": "help@contoso.onmicrosoft.com",
            "userType": "Member"
        },
        
        ...
    ]
}
```

###Calling OData actions or functions
The Microsoft Graph API also supports OData actions and functions to manipulate the resources. 
For example, the following HTTPS POST request lets the signed-in user (`me`) send an email message:
```no-highlight 
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/microsoft.graph.sendMail HTTP/1.1
authorization: bearer <access_token>
content-type: application/json
content-length: 96

{
  "message": {
    "subject": "Meet for lunch?",
    "body": {
      "contentType": "Text",
      "content": "The new cafeteria is open."
    },
    "toRecipients": [
      {
        "emailAddress": {
          "address": "garthf@a830edad9050849NDA1.onmicrosoft.com"
        }
      }
    ],
    "attachments": [
      {
        "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.OutlookServices.FileAttachment",
        "name": "menu.txt",
        "contentBytes": "bWFjIGFuZCBjaGVlc2UgdG9kYXk="
      }
    ]
  },
  "saveToSentItems": "false"
}
```

The request payload contains the input to the `microsoft.graph.sendMail` action, which is also defined in the $metadata.

With a single unified endpoint, the Microsoft Graph simplifies the application programming interface for services in the Microsoft cloud. As a result, the boundaries of the otherwise silo-ed services disappear. As an app developer, you are no longer required to keep track of the data sources and to implement custom interfaces between various data sources.
